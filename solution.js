The provided solution requires a thorough check of your Android development environment.  First, clean your project:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
```

Then, verify your Android SDK installation and ensure all necessary components are installed and updated.  Specifically, check for updates to build tools, platforms, and the Android Gradle Plugin.  Finally, open the project in Android Studio, and let Android Studio sync the Gradle project to identify and resolve any potential configuration issues.
If issues persist, you may need to investigate your Gradle files (e.g. `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`) to ensure compatibility of Gradle versions.
